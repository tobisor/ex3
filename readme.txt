1. the goal behind the UI was to create a LOGIN page,different REGISTER page and another page to control conveniently all oranges' (=items) APIs. 
2. The first UI page ,which is the login pageshould be accessible via http://localhost:8080/public/hello.html. you can use our details:
a. user= omer password =123
b. user= or   password =123
or else, click "register" to go to the register page and register with new user.
after registration/login you will be trasfered to the ITEM's page.
in this page tou can delete orange by entering his ID, you can 
get an existing orange by entering his ID and add(=post) or edit (put) an orange by filling the fields and press the one of the buttons.
pressing the "list" button will show you the updated orange list.
